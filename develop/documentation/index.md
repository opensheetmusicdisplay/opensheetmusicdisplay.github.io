## Basic class overview
This graphic shows a rough overview over the most used classes and their dependencies. Note that most classes lack their properties and methods. This is to keep the diagram as lean as possible (well, it came out quite messy anyways so we don't want to scare you with even more details). 
It contains all needed namespaces and gives a good top down overview where you might find which class in the code.
